            <Typography variant="inherit">Aiso was built to address the college-student need for housing after the COVID-19 outbreaks. As universities across the country responded to the virus by shutting down operations, many students found themselves suddenly out of housing and with no place to go.</Typography>
            <br/><br/>
            <Typography variant="inherit">We wanted to build a platform where alumni, faculty, and fellow students could offer up spaces in their homes to fellow students less-fortunate. Along the way, we realized that this platform could be used beyond cases of national emergency. By keeping listings within members of a given university, there is a certain amount of comfort, connection, and camaraderie that exists. Whether you are a faculty member looking to fill your summer with lively students or a college student looking to find a roommate to split rent on internship housing, Project Student Relief is a place to connect you with people within your network.</Typography>
            <br/><br/>
            <Typography variant="inherit">We will continue to be a resource, first and foremost, for those who are looking for housing in times of emergency. However, the need to share housing, find housing, offer housing will always exist. We will try our best to foster a space where those needs can be met.</Typography>
            <br/><br/>
            <Typography variant="inherit">We can&#39;t do this alone. We hope you will join us.</Typography>
